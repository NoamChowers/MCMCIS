This repository implements MCMC-based algorithms for p-value estimation of permutation tests.
SmoothedMCMCIS is an experimental algorithm, that samples from the permutation space via importance sampling, with exponentially-smoothed step function with the maximal mass on the tail of the distribution.
SAMC (Stochastic Approximation in Monte Carlo) is a python implementation of the algorithm described in Yu et al. (2011).
